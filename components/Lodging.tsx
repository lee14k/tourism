            Taniti has a wide variety of lodging that ranges from an inexpensive
            hostel to one large, four-star resort. There are many small,
            family-owned hotels and a growing number of bed and breakfasts. All
            types of lodging are strictly regulated and regularly inspected by
            the Tanitian government.
