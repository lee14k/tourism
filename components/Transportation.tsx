              Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on
              a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night
              per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate
              small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of
              expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the
              island within the next few years. Ground Transportation: Public
              buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day.
              Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in
              Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental
              agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent
              from several vendors (helmets are required by law). Taniti City is
              fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area
              surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on
              foot.
